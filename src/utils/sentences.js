    "Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition in being comparatively modern.",
    "For although the Chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the Netherlands",
    "And it is worth mention in passing that, as an example of fine typography,",
    "Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.",
    "Now, as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress,",
    "And it was a matter of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were,",
    "The Middle Ages brought calligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore",
    "The first books were printed in black letter, i.e. the letter which was a Gothic development of the ancient Roman character,",
    "The earliest book printed with movable type, the aforesaid Gutenberg Bible, is printed in letters which are an exact imitation",
    "On the whole the type of this book may be considered the ne-plus-ultra of Gothic type,",
    "But though on the whole, except in Italy, Gothic letter was most often used",
    "In fourteen sixty-five Sweynheim and Pannartz began printing in the monastery of Subiaco near Rome,",
    "They printed very few books in this type, three only; but in their very first books in Rome, beginning with the year fourteen sixty-eight,",
    "But about the same year Mentelin at Strasburg began to print in a type which is distinctly Roman;",
    "The Roman type of all these printers is similar in character,",
    "It must be said that it is in no way like the transition type of Subiaco,",
    "A further development of the Roman letter took place at Venice.",
    "John of Spires and his brother Vindelin, followed by Nicholas Jenson, began to print in that city,",
    "Of Jenson it must be said that he carried the development of Roman type as far as it can go",
    "After his death in the fourteen eighties, or at least by fourteen ninety, printing in Venice had declined very much;",
    "Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,",
    "It was these great Venetian printers, together with their brethren of Rome, Milan,",
    "Parma, and one or two other cities, who produced the splendid editions of the Classics, which are one of the great glories of the printer's art,",
    "It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries",
    "Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter,",
    "This was notably the case with the early works printed at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.",
    "In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type  is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.",
    "In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile of printed books, Gothic was the favorite.",
    "The characteristic Dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising Gothic.",
    "This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor,",
    "Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.",
    "After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially in Germany and Italy,",
    "In England about this time, an attempt was made notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a type-founder in seventeen twenty",
    "Caslon's type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed;",
    "In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.",
    "The seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.",
    "But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.",
    "It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,",
    "With this change the art of printing touched bottom,",
    "The Chiswick press in eighteen forty-four revived Caslon's founts, printing for Messrs. Longman the Diary of Lady Willoughby.",
    "This experiment was so far successful that about eighteen fifty Messrs. Miller and Richard of Edinburgh",
    "These and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others,",
    "It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,",
    "It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to Great Britain.",
    "Here and there a book is printed in France or Germany with some pretension to good taste,",
    "Italy is contentedly stagnant.",
    "America has produced a good many showy books, the typography, paper, and illustrations of which are, however, all wrong,",
    "To say a few words on the principles of design in typography",
    "Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect",
    "In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type",
    "In the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;",
    "One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity",
    "Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square,",
    "Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading",
    "Here, again, if the practice of leading were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.",
    "One very important matter in setting up for fine printing is the spacing, that is, the lateral distance of words from one another.",
    "In good printing the spaces between the words should be as near as possible equal",
    "But another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard;",
    "The general solidity of a page is much to be sought for",
    "For where these are boldly and carefully designed, and each letter is thoroughly individual in form,",
    "No definite rules, however, except the avoidance of rivers and excess of white, can be given for the spacing,",
    "The position of the page on the paper should be considered if the book is to have a satisfactory look.",
    "Here once more the almost invariable modern practice is in opposition to a natural sense of proportion.",
    "From the time when books first took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth century, or indeed later,",
    "The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper",
    "The paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad even in this country, but is beaten in the race for vileness",
    "There seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made,",
    "One fruitful source of badness in paper",
    "On the whole, a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent.",
    "The paper used for printing the small highly ornamented French service-books about the beginning of the sixteenth century is a model in this respect,",
    "However, the fact must not be blinked that machine-made paper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as that made by hand.",
    "The ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt with fully here; but one thing must be said on it.",
    "The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether picture or pattern-work, should form part of the page,",
    "should be a part of the whole scheme of the book.",
    "Simple as this proposition is, it is necessary to be stated,",
    "The due relation of letter to pictures and other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old printers; so that",
    "When, as is most often the case, there is actual beauty in the cuts,",
    "Therefore, granted well-designed type, due spacing of the lines and words, and proper position of the page on the paper,",
    "The Chronicles of Newgate, Volume two. By Arthur Griffiths. Section four: Newgate down to eighteen eighteen.",
    "Under the conditions referred to in the previous chapter,",
    "The new jail fell as far short of the demands made on it as did the old.",
    "The prison population fluctuated a great deal,",
    "Neild gives some figures which well illustrate this.",
    "On the fourteenth June, eighteen hundred, there were one hundred ninety-nine debtors and two hundred eighty-nine felons in the prison.",
    "On the twenty-seventh April, in the following year,",
    "For two more years these high figures were steadily maintained, and in eighteen oh three the total rose to seven hundred ten.",
    "After that they fell as steadily,",
    "The numbers soon increased, however, and by eighteen eleven had again risen to six hundred twenty-nine; and Mr. Reagan was told that there had been at one time",
    "Previous to that date there had been seven hundred or eight hundred frequently, and once, in Mr. Akerman's time, one thousand.",
    "Trustworthy evidence is forthcoming to the effect that these high figures were constantly maintained for many months at a time.",
    "The inadequacy of the jail was noticed and reported upon again and again by the grand juries of the city of London,",
    "On the female side matters were much worse;",
    "Returns laid before the House of Commons showed that six thousand, four hundred thirty-nine persons had been committed to Newgate",
    "In order to realize the evils entailed by incarceration in Newgate in these days, it is necessary to give some account of its interior",
    "The jail at that date was divided into eight separate and more or less distinct departments, each of which had its own wards and yard.",
    "Of these wards, three were appropriated to the cabin side, so called because",
    "Two other wards were appropriated to the master's side debtors; they were each twenty-three feet by fourteen and a half,",
    "The various wards were all about eleven feet in height,",

    'Hmm. LSP\'s injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. Beemo, take a sample and do a full blood analysis.  Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There\'s a drugstore across the street!',
    'What the-?! Jake! What\'s with all the turning into stuff today?',
    'Roll the dice, you pay the price.',
    'Man, we didn\'t just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!',
    'Trespassers get killed mad quick, like zap-zap.',
    '"Entanglement" is a spell where you get trapped in tree roots, and sometimes they spike out and hook your flesh, and you got to be like, "My body is clay, my spirit feels no pain." Then you chop your way out and kill the wizard!',
    'I got traumatized by those underpanties.',
    'Your magicks are powerful, Princess.',
    'Yeah, Beemo, show me the stuff, keep it coming!',
    'C\'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe.',
    'Dude, I\'m graceful. Mom raised me graceful.',
    'Dude, what the bjork?',
    'Jake, it\'s my special occasion phone! Someone\'s calling me to tell me about a special occasion.',
    'Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin\' that heat on my skull!',
    'It was weird but I liked it.',
    'Naw, that\'s all fine. I just been feeling kind of gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y\'know?',
    'I found it in the woods. I named it "Hot Daniel." Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it.',
    'Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!',
    'Jeez. Did I just get shown up by Cinnamon Bun?',
    'Off the dome, here we go. Uh! I\'m-a start it now. I\'m-a battle now. We gonna make a rhyme, so I can rap this time.',
    'Dude, I found out my human dad is still alive.',
    'Why\'d you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby???',
    'Heh? Stop meddling, boy! You and your magical dog can\'t harm me.',
    'I\'m going to make one marry me!',
    'Your hat is stupid!',
    'Now I\'ve got you, boy!',
    'Fool! Your powers are no match for my magical crown!',
    'My powers! Foul and noisome whelp! You\'ve not seen the last of my wintery fangs! I\'ll cleave the warmth from your bones and stop still your beating heart with my claws',
    'Do you know what "The King" means?!',
    'Ladies! I brought you a baby, and a puppy!',
    'I\'ll show you fun. Fun is my middle name!',
    'Play it or I\'ll squish you into juice!',
    'I am the king! I am the king of cool!',
    'Ooh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom.',
    'Who are you? Ha ha ha! I know, you\'re probably a big neeeerd! Hey baby, why don\'t you try being cool like me?',
    'This is my domain!',
    'Fat! Fat! Fat! Daddy\'s little fatty. Oh, you\'ll never get a prom date with all that tub on your face, you know?',
    'Finn? Ugh! Why can\'t you ever be a princess?',
    'Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet!',
    'Now finally I can kill you! Oh, wait. I am so stupid. Silly billy. I came by to tell you the good news. I\'m getting married to someone who wants to marry me."',
    'Strangling the groom\'s nose at a wedding?! What\'s wrong with you?!',
    'Gunter, who told you you could fly?',
    'No one sucks the life from my penguins except me and maybe polar bears, because that\'s just nature.',
    'You\'ve raised my frosty dander!',
    'I\'ve soiled my tunic, completely by choice!',
    'Finn! You have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle!',
    'These bars won\'t hold me forever! Hey, there\'s only like two of them.',
    'I\'m toying with you psychologically!',
    'Ha ha ha ha ha! I\'m rockin\' your world view!',
    'So, let me get this straight. You\'re hitting on me.',
    'I\'m a banana!!',
    'Gunter, you\'re embarrassing me!',
    'Gunter was preggers!',
    'I\'m sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. Nobody in the world.',
    'Hey. I had to keep an eye on the Princess because she\'s being possessed by the Lich.',
    'Because when you have stanky old Wizard Eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it\'s like crazy, crazy, crazy, in your face, all the time. All the time.',
    'Okay, I didn\'t kill her this time. Everybody saw that, right?',
    'Whoa! You are fast and quiet and very good at dramatic silence. I like it.',
    'No! Come back, you wussy!',
    'Look, a supermodel! Look, a hoverboard! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boingloings! Hit in the boingloings! Boingloings! Boingloings! Somebody got hit in them. Peace out!',
    'I take artful black-and-white photographs of my penguin\'s body parts.',
    'After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in Northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiance, Betty. I jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something. And that\'s when it started, the visions. I fought with them, shouted at them until I realized it wasn\'t real, it was the crown! I quickly took it off, and saw my fiancee in front of me, looking at me with such contempt! What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is, I never saw Betty again.',
    'I know my mind is changing but I\'m already gone too far to know what to do. I want people to know that if I do things that, if I do things that hurt anyone, please, please forgive me.',
    'Just watch over me until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe Betty, my princess, maybe you will love me again. Please love me again, Betty!',
    'Now you know my secret! You know that I used to wear glasses!',
    'Gunter, are you blowin\' it up in here? You are nasty, Gunter. You got a nasty booty, mister. Nasty!',
    'Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad.',
    '"What do you think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach in to the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns, this random pattern generator. So clever. Right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror."',
    'Wizards only, fools, keep it tight.',
    'J. T. Dawgzone always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros. with tortured pasts." And I\'ve got a way tortured past! I think.',
    'I just wanted to be loved!',
    'Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and never more re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?',
    'I know you are out there somewhere. I just haven\'t figured out how to get to you. But believe me, I will. I will.',
    'This island doesn\'t have a lady, this island is a lady!',
    'Yeah, well the Princess is just so closed off to her emotions. She crushes the relationship so she doesn\'t even have to develop feelings.',
    'Banana Guards yourself, Princess!',
    'Oh, hey, kids! Fine day for a picnic.',
    'Actually, I think I\'m beating it back with sheer willpower. Oh, my.',
    'No! Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! Oh yeah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy.',
    'Sleds are for suckers! Just ride on my gut!',
    'Slime Princess, you shouldn\'t marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time.',
    'She got past me, man. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me.',
    'Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun\'s sake, alright?',
    'Seriously. For a watermelon, you get into trouble way more often than you should.',
    'Hey, shorty. You should pick your boogers and then fart! You look kinda like a big pink baguette!',
    'I keep finding baby shoes. What the heck, man? And they\'re all lefties!',
    'You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.',
    'He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool, guys.',
    'This dolphin fell in love with me!',
    'I wasn\'t scared! I was singing! I was singing my scream song. Wooaah! Wooaaooh!',
    'Finn, House-hunting is wiiiild! You\'ve got to try it.',
    'I\'d rather be dancin\' with some babes!',
    'My subconscious must be hungry, huh?',
    'You guys are so cute, I could just maul you to death.',
    'Hey, hey. Come on, the ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.',
    'I can\'t have you messin\' up my bread and butter, dude.',
    'And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times!',
    'Whatever you want, mama.',
    'Come put her out of her misery, dude.',
    'I choose sandwich!',
    'Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!',
    'Nah, we\'re more like cops. Crooked cops!',
    'I could probably think of a reason of why that\'s villainous if you gave me enough time.',
    'I\'ll kill you and raise your children as my own!',
    'I\'m gonna go rescue all the babies in town. Only the babies.',
    'Get your hero on, dude!',
    'Heh heh. I can\'t take you seriously when you\'re singing, man.',
    'Safety! Patrol! Safety patrol! Oh, were we not wearing the uniforms?',
    'I have pants! Spun from spider webs by pixies.',
    'I wanna help you outta this, man, but she scares the filling outta my doughnut!',
    'Don\'t you worry, Finn. I\'ll get you out of there. I\'ve got a perfect plan!  I\'m not running away, Finn! This is just part of my plan!',
    'I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!',
    'The bazooka goblin has you in its sights!',
    'Oh man, I imagined my mom naked! Yuck!',
    'Dude, be calmed by my saliva.',
    'Dude, suckin\' at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something. You and I are like little baby Billys right now. And we\'re "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk.',
    'I\'m not cute, I\'ll mess you up!',
    'Hey, get outta here, horse! I wanna go to sleep and you\'re creeping me the math out!',
    'Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It\'s got poobrain.',
    'Yeah. I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poobrain 5 minutes ago.',
    'Dude, let\'s kill the horse.',
    'Did you find out that I sleep in the nude? It\'s none of your business how nude I sleep, The King! None of your business!',
    'You don\'t just read the poetry to understand it, you got to feel it.',
    'Then just make it think it\'s her idea. That\'s how you make the ladies do what you want.',
    'Bad computer! No! No! Go sit in the corner, and think about your life.',
    'Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?',
    'Dude, I\'m going in.',
    'If I had a penny for every time someone went crazy, hopped up and magic energy, I\'d be Abraham Lincoln.',
    'Uh-oh. Somebody\'s gonna do a quest for a frog.',
    'Gee! Sittin\' in this hot sun guarding beans. Boy, it sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream, or caramel ice cream, or peach ice cream.',
    'This pod makes ice cream outta nothing! It\'s the goodest thing that\'s ever happened to me.',
    'Buddy, just breathe into me.',
    'Hey, Finn, let\'s split. This turned out to be boring.',
    'It\'s probably a computal gleetch.',
    'Easy peasy, livin\' greasy!',
    'They\'re trying to peel me! I\'m not a banana!',
    'We can rule them, like gods, angry gods.',
    'You killed her. Yep. Felled by surface world germs.',
    'You\'re sick, Party Pat! I\'m gonna go watch T.V.',
    'Hey man, watch it. I think that\'s my nerp, but like super stretched out.',
    'Yeah, I could go for some blood.',
    'And what if we turn evil? I\'ll have to start wearing cologne.',
    'I love you, Everything burrito.',
    'Wanna just smash \'em all?',
    'Tastes better than blood! Or does it? Hey Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?',
    ' Meat Man. I\'m sorry, Meat Man. I didn\'t mean it, man.',
    'It\'s not easy, but you have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, or warp through several worlds. But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in the water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, you walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch. Does that make sense?',
    'Well, I know what\'s missing. Talent. I\'m getting out of here, you hacks. Talentless hacks!',
    'Oh, I\'m coming with you, if only to be disruptive and obnoxious!',
    'Fish People! I\'ll be, um, a dolphin!',
    'Whatever, man. This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain, and I\'m a crazy clam shell!',
    'I\'m puttin\' an end to all this craziness with my Pick-Axe Hand.',
    'This ghost ain\'t home, man.',
    'Gotta find a honey for my homie! A baby for my buddy! A lady for my laddie!',
    'They\'re all burned! There\'s barbequed bods everywhere!',
    'Love like theirs will always find a way. It will crawl up all over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out. Circle of life, Finn… circle of life.',
    'Yaaaaaaay! Noooooo!',
    'Your heart may be small, but it\'s strong as a bull donk, and I know. You can wait through this line, so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we\'re here and why we we\'re in a pile of bañanles.',
    'It\'s not answering questions, man. That thing\'s gonna bake our beans!',
    'When you see the wicker devil in the tree afterlife, tell him Jake says, "Hello."',
    'Jakoria will reclaim what we have lost!',
    'Let me explain some junk about dating. Right now you\'re at tier one, which is hugging, but pretty soon you\'ll be at tier two, which is smooching. Then down the road you\'ll reach tier five, when she\'ll let you discover all fifteen feet of her long, beautiful stomach. And after a while you\'ll make it to tier eight where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.',
    'Stay away from that! Do not do tier fifteen!',
    'Ok, Princess. You need to stop breaking in here!',
    'Back off Bubblegum, that\'s his man\'s biz.',
    'You heartless monster! Do you have any idea how much he\'s cried over you? Finn deserves to be happy! Even if his bloopin\' face gets burned off. You should be ashamed. You\'re sick!',
    'I\'m-- puppies?!',
    'Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.',
    'Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me siiick',
    'I dreamed I was in kindergarten again, but I had really big feet, and was also the teacher.',
    'I wish for a sandwich!',
    'Oh, what a good boy am I!',
    'Don\'t let the dragon drag on.',
    'Being crazy is hard. You’re getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what’s real, man.',
    'Hey, a bubble! Pop!',
    'I look pretty!',
    'I really like turnin\' into cop stuff. I literally can\'t stop turning into cop stuff.',
